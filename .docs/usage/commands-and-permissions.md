This pages contains all the commands inside SWM, alongside their respective permissions and usages. Arguments within angle brackets are required, and the ones within square brackets are optional.

The `swm.*` permission will grant access to all commands.

### /swm load
Permission required: `swm.loadworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm load <world>`<br>
Description: Loads a world from the config file. Remember to configure the world after converting it to the SRF. More on that [here](https://github.com/Grinderwolf/Slime-World-Manager/wiki/Configuring-worlds).

Usage: `/swm load-template <template-world> <world>`<br>

Since version: 2.2.0.<br>
Description: Creates a clone of the provided template world. If not provided, SWM will use the data source of the template world to save the clone.

**Cloned worlds are temporary, and they will never be actually stored anywhere, so any changes to them will be lost once the server is shut down.**

### /swm create
Permission required: `swm.createworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm create <world> <data-source>`<br>
Since version: 1.1.0.<br>
Description: Creates an empty world and stores it in the provided data source. This command will also automatically save the world in the config file.

### /swm unload

### /swm delete
Permission required: `swm.deleteworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm delete <world> [data-source]`<br>
Description: Completely deletes a world. If a data source is not provided, the one specified in the config file will be used. 

**This action is permanent, and there's no way to go back once the world is deleted.** To make sure you are not doing this by mistake, you'll have to type the command twice.
