### /swm load

Permission required: `swm.loadworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm load <world>`<br>

Description: Creates a clone of the provided template world. If not provided, SWM will use the data source of the
template world to save the clone.

**Cloned worlds are temporary, and they will never be actually stored anywhere, so any changes to them will be lost once
the server is shut down.**

### /swm create

Permission required: `swm.createworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm create <world> <data-source>`<br>
Since version: 1.1.0.<br>

### /swm delete

Permission required: `swm.deleteworld`<br>
Usage: `/swm delete <world> [data-source]`<br>
Description: Completely deletes a world. If a data source is not provided, the one specified in the config file will be
used.

**This action is permanent, and there's no way to go back once the world is deleted.** To make sure you are not doing
this by mistake, you'll have to type the command twice.
