Slime World Manager supports three data sources out of the box: the filesystem, MySQL and MongoDB. However, there are
situations where you might want to use other data sources. To do so, you can create your own implementation of the
SlimeLoader interface.

SlimeLoaders are classes used to load worlds from specific data sources. Remember to check out
the [docs](https://grinderwolf.github.io/Slime-World-Manager/apidocs/) for the SlimeLoader interface prior to creating
your own implementation, as it contains information on what every method should exactly do. You can also take a look at
the [FileLoader class](../../slimeworldmanager-plugin/src/main/java/com/grinderwolf/swm/plugin/loaders/FileLoader.java)
for an example of a SlimeLoader.

Once you've got your own SlimeLoader, remember to register it so you can use it later:

```java
SlimePlugin plugin = (SlimePlugin) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("SlimeWorldManager");

plugin.registerLoader("my_data_source", new MyCustomSlimeLoader());
```
